### Upcoming Events 

This week, we're conducting a documentation sprint for the RDO
docs and website. We're working on the [open issues
list](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues). 

Goals for this doc day include:

* Knock out as many of the [open issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues) as possible.

* Identify docs that are outdated, and/or refer to end-of-lifed releases (eg. [328](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues/328) and [141](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues/141)).

* Consolidate duplicate docs (eg. [142](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues/142)).

* Improve the test day instructions, so that people don't have to be experts to participate.

Next week, we will be conducting at test day for RDO packages of the
Mitaka Milestone 3. Details for that test day, and instructions for
testing, are on the [RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/mitaka/milestone3/).

In conjunction with this test day, we are conducting the first on-site
test day at the Red Hat Brno office. You will need to
[register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rdo-on-site-test-day-brno-tickets-5934822213)
for this event, so that we know how much food to order. Further
details about the event may be found on the [event
page](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/mitaka/brno-on-site/)

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed on the [RDO events
page](http://rdoproject.org/events).
If you have
an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull
request to

### Blog Posts

February saw a great surge in great blog posts around RDO, as often
happens as we pass the midpoint of an OpenStack upstream cycle. I'd
like to particularly draw attention to a few of them.

Nick Barcet wrote an article talking about [Why, and What, Red Hat
works on in
OpenStack](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/02/why-does-red-hat-contribute-to-rdo/).
He explains which portions of OpenStack we focus on, and why.
Red Hat is, and always has been, dedicated to working upstream first.
RDO is critical to our product offerings, because it identifies early
what customers will care about. 

The video from the RDO Community Day at FOSDEM is now all online, on
the [event
page](https://www.rdoproject.org/events/rdo-day-fosdem-2016/). The
camera battery died miday through the next-to-last presentation, so
we're missing some footage. But we have everyone's slides.

David Moreau Simard spoke at the Montreal OpenStack Meetup group,
giving a great [overview of RDO
CI](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/02/david-moreau-simard-at-openstack-montreal/).
This should give anyone a deeper understanding of what we're doing,
and why.

The project formerly known as RDO Manager [is now just
TripleO](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/02/rdo-manager-is-now-tripleo/).
Rain Leander explains why this decision was made. (It was the right
thing to do.)

Finally, Chandan Kumar has written a bit about [how he got involved in
RDO](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/03/how-i-started-contributing-to-rdo-project/),
and OpenStack in general, and why you should, too.

Every week, I post a round up of blog posts from the various RDO
enthusiasts around the world, and that's also a great way to keep up
with what's happening in RDO, and in OpenStack as a whole. Catch that
every Monday on the [RDO blog](http://rdoproject.org/blog/).

### Packaging meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. And at 15:00 UTC Thursdays, we
have the CentOS Cloud SIG Meeting on #centos-devel.

### Bug Statistics 

The weekly bug statistics reports are great for tracking the progress 
of the project, and are also
an excellent place to look if you're getting started and looking for
something to start working on.

You can see the latest of these messages in the [rdo-list
archive](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2016-March/msg00004.html)
