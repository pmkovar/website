## Community Events

We're just a few days into February, and there's already a lot to
report on!

### FOSDEM and the RDO Community Day

Last week, around 45 RDO enthusiasts gathered at the IBM Client Center
in Brussels for our first all-day RDO Community Day, which was held in
conjunction with the CentOS Dojo. We had a great opening keynote from
Thomas Oulevey from CERN, and then a day full of informative sessions
about all aspects of RDO and RDO-Manager.

The full schedule, along with slides and videos, is [on the event
page](https://www.rdoproject.org/events/rdo-day-fosdem-2016/) (There's over
80GB of videos, so they're still uploading. Check back in a few days
for the rest of them.) You can also read some about the event, and see
some photos, on the [RDO
blog](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/02/rdo-community-day-at-fosdem/)

Over the weekend, RDO had a big presence at FOSDEM, both at our table
in the expo hall, and as part of the Virtualiazation devroom.

### DevConf.cz

Tomorrow, we will be at [DevConf](http://devconf.cz) with many of
our engineers, and we'll have a table where you can get RDO tshirts
and stickers. We would love to see you there. Follow @RDOCommunity on
Twitter for reminders of upcoming OpenStack-related sessions.

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed at [on the RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events).

Instructions for submitting your event may be found [here](https://www.rdoproject.org/events/edit/).

## Test Days, Doc Days

This year we are trying to do a test day, and a doc sprint day, every
month. See the [test day schedule](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/)
for details.

Our next test day will be held Feb 18-19.

The doc days information is [on the website](https://www.rdoproject.org/events/docdays/) 
but we haven't nailed down
the doc day dates for February, since so many of us have been
traveling. But watch our Twitter feed and the rdo-list mailing list
for updates.

## Packaging meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. And at 15:00 UTC Thursdays, we
have the CentOS Cloud SIG Meeting on #centos-devel.

The minutes for each of these meetings are posted each week [here](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting) and
[here](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/cloud-sig-meeting) respectively.

## Bug Statistics 

Chandan Kumar has started posting weekly bug statistics summaries.
These are great for tracking the progress of the project, and are also
an excellent place to look if you're getting started and looking for
something to start working on.

You can see the latest of these bug stats postings on the [RDO mailing
list](http://rdo.fosslists.org/thread.html/Zo197yzql56qv92).
