It's been a very busy summer so far, and there's still a lot coming up.
The very best ways to keep up with what's happening in RDO is to get on
the [mailing list](http://rdoproject.org/community/mailing-lists/) and
to follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rdocommunity/).

## Red Hat Summit

We just came back from Red Hat Summit, where we had a presence in the
Community Central pavilion in the expo hall. We shared that space with
our friends at [Ansible, CentOS, Atomic, Ceph, and many other community
projects](http://eventsblog.redhat.com/2016/06/28/go-upstream-at-summit-community-central/).

Highlights of the week included [Rain Leander's presentation on becoming
a contributor to the TripleO
project](https://rh2016.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=75677&tclass=popup),
and [Cumulus Networks' demo of their Rack On A Laptop OpenStack
setup](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/215832697-Demo-OpenStack-Cumulus-VX-Rack-on-a-Laptop-Part-I-L2-MLAG-).

We also had a USB drive containing the TripleO QuickStart image, so that
one can get a single-node OpenStack installation up and running in just
minutes. You'll soon be able to download the image [from the RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/), or you can come get one from
me at [LinuxCon next month on
Toronto](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america).

## Upcoming Events 

July is OpenStack Birthday month, and so you'll see birthday meetups
cropping up all over the world. Check on
[Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) for OpenStack meetups near you, or
watch the calendar on [the RDO events
site](https://www.rdoproject.org/events/).

There's also a number of [OpenStack
Days](https://www.openstack.org/community/events/openstackdays) events
where Red Hat is sponsoring, or where we'll have an RDO presence of some
kind:

* [OpenStack Days Tokyo](http://openstackdays.com/en/) (July 6-7)
* [OpenStack Days Taiwan](http://openstack.ithome.com.tw/) (July 12)
* [OpenStack Day China](http://openstackdaychina.org/) (July 14-15)
* [OpenStack Days Silicon Valley](https://www.openstacksv.com/) (August
  9-10)
* [OpenStack Days East](http://www.openstackeast.com/) (August 23-24)

We'd love to see you there. Come, and bring your RDO questions and
stories to share.

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed [on the RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events)

## Test Day, July 21, 22

Newton Milestone 2 is due [next
week](http://releases.openstack.org/newton/schedule.html), and so we'll
be having an RDO test day, [July 21 and
22](http://rdoproject.org/testday/newton/milestone2), to verify that the RDO
packages, produced from that milestone, are ready. Please join us in 
the #rdo channel on Freenode IRC as we test, so that we can ensure that
Newton is the best release of RDO yet.
