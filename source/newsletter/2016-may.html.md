## What did you do in Mitaka?

The RDO community is absolutely delighted to announce that [RDO packages
for Mitaka have been released](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/rdo-mitaka-released/).
You can try out OpenStack Mitaka today using the
[QuickStart](https://rdoproject.org/Quickstart), or using
[TripleO](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/).

It's worth taking a moment to celebrate before we forge ahead with
Newton. I have been having a series of conversations with some of our
engineers about what they did in Mitaka, and they're well worth your
time:

* [Ivan Chavero](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-ivan-chavero/)
* [Ihar Hrachyshka](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-ihar-hrachyshka-talks-about-neutron/)
* [Chandan Kumar](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-chandan-kumar/)
* [Haïkel Guémar](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-haikel-guemar/)
* [Javier Peña](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-javier-pena/)

I also have interviews with Emilien Macchi and Adam Young recorded,
which will be published soon, and several others lined up. If you'd like
to talk about what you did in Mitaka, or about what's coming in Newton, just
[mailto:rbowen@redhat.com](let me know) and we'll set it up.

Our goal for this release was to get the RDO release out withing 2 days
of the upstream release. It happened in 2.5 hours. We're trying to
figure out how we can speed this up in Newton.

## OpenStack Summit, Austin

OpenStack Summit has come and gone, and what a week it was. A huge thank
you to everyone that helped out so much at the RDO demo stand,
especially our friends at Cumulus Networks who demoed their [rack on a
laptop](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/215832697-Demo-OpenStack-Cumulus-VX-Rack-on-a-Laptop-Part-I-L2-MLAG-)
setup.


Additionally, we had demos of TripleO, and various things running on top of RDO.

We had a great turnout at the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/rdo-bof-at-openstack-summit-austin/">RDO BoF</a> - more than 60 were in attendance. It's always encouraging to see you in person at these events.

## Red Hat Summit - June 28th, San Francisco
 
Next month, RDO will have a big presence at [Red Hat
Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit), where we'll have more demos
of deploying and using RDO, including another appearance from Cumulus,
and demos of TripleO. There's still time to register, and we hope to see
you in San Francisco!

## Newton, test days, and review.rdoproject.org

And now, it's on to Newton. We're really looking forward to what you'll
be doing in Newton. There are many ways that you can participate, and
we'd like to draw attention to a few of them in particular.

We have a tentative schedule of [upcoming test
days](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/) based on the Newton release
schedule. Participating in test
days, as well as writing instructions for what needs to be tested, is
both one of the best ways to help RDO's forward progress, and a great
way to involve beginners in the process.

Tracking what's happening in RDO is now much easier. We're delighted to
[announce
review.rdoproject.org](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/05/announcement-migration-to-reviewrdoprojectorg/)
entering production service. This should make it easier to participate
in the packaging work, clearer what's happening, and easlier to find all
of the various parts that used to be scattered across disparate
services. A huge thank you to the people who worked so hard to make this
happen. Listen to my [interview with
Haikel](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-haikel-guemar/)
for more background on what this involved, and why it was necessary.

Each week I post a list of unanswered RDO questions, from
ask.openstack.org, to the rdo-list mailing list. [Here's the latest
one](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2016-May/msg00004.html).
Keeping this list down to manageable levels helps our extended community
of users to solve their problems in a timely manner, and provides
permanent documentation for those that come afterwards with the same
questions. Please consider giving a few minutes this week to looking at
one of those questions and providing an answer. Thanks!
