On Tuesday evening I had the privilege of addressing the [St. Louis OpenStack Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-STL/events/229344473/). I gave an Introduction to OpenStack presentation to about 30 attendees, many of whom were indeed OpenStack beginners, or just beginning to research what this OpenStack thing is all about.

There were roughly 30 people in attendance, and questions ranged across a variety of topics, including ease of deployment, ongoing support, and the upgrade path for future versions.

A huge thank you is due to CenturyLink, who hosted the meetup in their beautiful office facility, and to  Ranga Chakravarthula, who coordinated everything.
