If you'll be in Barcelona later this month for [OpenStack Summit](http://openstack.org/summit), join us for an evening with RDO and Ceph.

Tuesday evening, October 25th, from 5 to 8pm (17:00 - 20:00) we'll be at the [Barcelona Princess](http://en.hotelbarcelonaprincess.com/restaurants/the-gym-bar/), right across the road from the Summit venue. We'll have drinks, light snacks, and presentations from both Ceph and RDO.

If you can't make it in person, we'll also be [streaming the event on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji-WqEXZRT)

Topics we expect to be covered include (not necessarily in this order):

* RDO release status (aarch64, repos, workflow)
* RDO repos overview (CBS vs Trunk, and what goes where)
* RDO and Ceph (maybe TripleO and Ceph?)
* Quick look at new rpmfactory workflow with rdopkg 
* CI in RDO - what are we testing?
* CERN -- How to replace several petabytes of Ceph hardware without downtime
* Ceph at  SUSE
* Ceph on ARM
* 3D Xpoint & 3D NAND with OpenStack and Ceph
* Bioinformatics -- Openstack and Ceph used in large scale cancer research projects

If you expect to be at the event, please consider [signing up on Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/an-evening-of-ceph-and-rdo-tickets-28022550202) so we have an idea of how many people to expect. Thanks!
