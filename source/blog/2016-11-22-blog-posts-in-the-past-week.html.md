**New TLS algorithm priority config for libvirt with gnutls on Fedora >= 25** by Daniel Berrange

> Libvirt has long supported use of TLS for its remote API service, using the gnutls library as its backend. When negotiating a TLS session, there are a huge number of possible algorithms that could be used and the client & server need to decide on the best one, where “best” is commonly some notion of “most secure”. The preference for negotiation is expressed by simply having an list of possible algorithms, sorted best to worst, and the client & server choose the first matching entry in their respective lists. Historically libvirt has not expressed any interest in the handshake priority configuration, simply delegating the decision to the gnutls library on that basis that its developers knew better than libvirt developers which are best. In gnutls terminology, this means that libvirt has historically used the “DEFAULT” priority string.

We have grown alot of content since that time, but the overall styling and layout of the libvirt website has not substantially changed. Compared to websites for more recently launched projects, libvirt was starting to look rather outdated. So I spent a little time to come up with a new design for the libvirt website to bring it into the modern era. There were two core aspects to the new design, simplify the layout and navigation, and implement new branding.
