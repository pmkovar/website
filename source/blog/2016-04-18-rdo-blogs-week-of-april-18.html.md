This has been a big few weeks for RDO, and for OpenStack in general, with the Mitaka release coming out, and OpenStack Summit just around the corner.

Here's some of what RDO enthusiasts have been blogging about in the last few days.

**RDO Mitaka released** by Rich Bowen

> The RDO community is pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Mitaka for RPM-based distributions - CentOS Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. RDO is suitable for building private, public, and hybrid clouds and Mitaka is the 13th release from the OpenStack project, which is the work of more than 2500 contributors from around the world.

**What, Why, and How is the CentOS Cloud SIG?** by Rich Bowen

> 2 years ago we started the CentOS Cloud SIG. Progress has been slow but steady. Slow, I think, because we've not done a wonderful job of explaining what it's for, and why it matters. But it has been a very important aspect of moving the RDO project forward, so it deserves better explanation.

**Naming is hard or Who Let The Vowels Out** by Alan Pevec 

> When Derek Higgins started the tool to build OpenStack packages based on latest upstream aka "trunk" changes, the name Delorean seemed like a good choice: the tool is keeping older builds so you could "go back in time" like with a time machine, it's geeky enough and there's Irish connection.

**Integrating OpenStack into the Enterprise** by Michael Solberg

> Adoption of OpenStack in the enterprise has been progressing steadily over the last two years. As a Forrester Report* on enterprise adoption from September noted, “OpenStack demonstrates the completeness, robustness, and capability upon which a broader range of adopters can depend.” OpenStack deployments have proven to be complex in larger IT organizations though, but not because of the reasons that you might anticipate. Much has been made about the complexity of installing the software, but we’ve found that the lion’s share of effort in these implementation comes around the practice of integrating IaaS into the fabric of enterprise IT and evolving existing processes to meet the expectations of the user community.

**Getting Started with Puppet for Keystone** by Adam Young

> Tripleo uses Puppet to manage the resources in a deployment. Puppet has a command line tool to look at resources.

**What did you do in Mitaka: Ihar Hrachyshka talks about Neutron** by Rich Bowen

> In this installment of our "What did you do in Mitaka?" series, Ihar Hrachyshka talks about his work on Neutron both in Mitaka, and what's planned for Newton.

**What did you do in Mitaka? : Ivan Chavero** by Rich Bowen 

> The OpenStack cloud software project recently released the Mitaka release. RDO is a community distribution of OpenStack. I've invited several of the engineers that work on RDO to talk about what they did in the Mitaka cycle.

**Learning something new about Oslo Versioned Objects** byGorka Eguileor

> If you work on an OpenStack project that is in the process of adopting Versioned Objects or has recently adopted them, like we have in Cinder, you’ve probably done some code reviews, and even implemented a couple of Versioned Objects yourself, and are probably thinking that you know your way around them pretty well, but maybe there are some gaps in that knowledge that you are not aware of, specially if you are taking Nova’s or Cinder’s code as reference, at least I know I had some gaps. If you aren’t a seasoned Versioned Object user like the Nova people are, I recommend you keep reading.

**TripleO with already deployed servers** by James Slagle

> Recently I’ve been prototyping how to use TripleO with already deployed
and provisioned servers. In such a scenario, Nova and Ironic would not be used
to do the initial operating system provisioning of the Overcloud nodes.
Instead, the nodes would already be powered on, running an OS, and ready to
start to configure OpenStack.
