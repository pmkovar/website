**How to fix a FTBFS using DLRN** by  Frederic Lepied

> DLRN is the tool used by the RDO project to build RPM packages for every commit from the OpenStack projects. See http://blogs.rdoproject.org/7834/delorean-openstack-packages-from-the-future for more details on how DLRN works. These commits from the upstream OpenStack projects can introduce changes that break the packaging. We call these FTBFS (Failure To Build From Source).

**Newbie in RDO: one size doesn't fit all** by amoralej 

> As a new contributor to the RDO project, one of my first tasks was to understand what is actually being produced by the project. According to RDO faq, the main goal is to maintain a freely-available, community-supported distribution of OpenStack based on RPM packages able to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and their derivatives. But the RDO community is diverse and different use patterns have been found over the time with different requirements:

**Newbie in RDO (2): RDO Trunk from a bird's eye view** by amoralej

> Time goes fast as a RDO newbie and once I understood what the RDO Trunk and CloudSIG repos provide (read my previous post if you still have doubts), my next goal was to have a clear high-level perspective of the entire delivery workflow followed in the project.

**Evolving the OpenStack HA Architecture** by Andy Beekhof

> In the current OpenStack HA architecture used by Red Hat, SuSE and others, Systemd is the entity in charge of starting and stopping most OpenStack services. Pacemaker exists as a layer on top, signalling when this should happen, but Systemd is the part making it happen.

**RDO @ Red Hat Summit** by Rich Bowen 

> Red Hat Summit is just a few weeks away, and it's a great place to learn about RDO, and deploying OpenStack on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS. If you're coming, be sure to drop by the RDO booth in the Community Central section of the exhibit hall. Grab an RDO tshirt, watch demos of what people are doing on top of RDO, and we'll have experts there to answer your questions.

**SAML Federated Auth Plugin** by Adam Young

> SAML is usually thought of as a WebSSO mechanism, but it can be made to work for command line operations if you use the Extended Client Protocol (ECP). When we did the Rippowam demo last year, we were successful in getting an Unscoped token by using ECP, but that was not sufficient to perform operations on other services that need a scoped token.
