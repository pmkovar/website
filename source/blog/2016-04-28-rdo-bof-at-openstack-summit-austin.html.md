On Tuesday afternoon about 60 people gathered for the RDO BoF (Birds of a Feather) session at OpenStack Summit in Austin.

*By the way, the term Birds of a Feather comes from the saying "Birds of a feather flock together", which refers to like-minded people gathering.*

The topics discussed can be found in the [agenda](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-austin-bof).

The network was friendly, and we managed to capture the whole session in a Google Hangout. The video of the session is [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmb3RA1GmGs).

And there are several pictures from the event on the [RDO Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/communities/110409030763231732154).

Thank you for all who attended. You'll see follow-up discussion on a number of the topics discussed on [rdo-list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list) over the coming weeks.
