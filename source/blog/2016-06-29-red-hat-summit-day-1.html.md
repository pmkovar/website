The first day at [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) in San Francisco was, as always, very busy, with hundreds of people coming by the Community Central area of the exhibit hall to learn about RDO, as wlel as other community projects including ManageIQ, Ceph, CentOS, and many others.

Due to the diverse nature of the audience, and their many reasons for attending Red Hat Summit, perhaps half of these attendees hadn't heard of RDO, whild most of them were familiar with OpenStack. So, we have many new people who are going to look at RDO as a way of trying ot OpenStack at their organizations.

If you're at Red Hat Summit, do stop by. We have lots of tshirts left, and we also have TripleO Qu ickStart  USB thumb drives so that you can try out RDO with minimal work. We're in Community Central, to your right as you enter the front doors of the Partner Pavillion.
