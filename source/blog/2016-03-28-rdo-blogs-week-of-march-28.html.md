Here's what RDO enthusiasts have been blogging about in the last week:

**Tie Your Rabbit Down** by Adam Young

> I’ve been running the Tripleo Quickstart to setup my development deployments. While looking into the setup, I noticed that the default Rabbit deployment is wide open. I can’t see anything other than firewall port blocking in place. I dug deeper.

**Red Hat confirms over 35 sessions at OpenStack Summit, Austin – Have a look!** by Jeff Jameson

> As this Spring’s 2016 OpenStack Summit in Austin, TX nears, the Foundation has posted the final session agenda, outlining the week’s schedule of events. I am pleased to see that based on your voting, Red Hat continues to remain in sync with the current topics, projects, and technologies the OpenStack community and customers are most interested in. With the expectation of the largest attendee crowd yet, and some exciting advancements around containers, storage, networking, compute, and more, we look forward to sharing the 35+ generally accepted sessions, workshops, and BoFs that will be included in the weeks agenda.

**Dependency Injection in Python applied to Ossipee** by Adam Young

> I reworked my OpenStack API based cluster builder Ossipee last weekend. It makes heavy use of dependency resolution now, and breaks apart the super-base class into properly scoped components.

**Convert a keystone.rc from V2 to V3** by Adam Young

**Long Term OpenStack Usage Summary** by SilverSkySoft

**Learn what’s coming in OpenStack “Mitaka”** by Jeff Jameson

> As the fastest growing open source project in history, OpenStack releases fairly rapidly, with new releases twice per year. Each time, around April and October of every year, a whole plethora of new features and functions move from incubated development status to fully-baked features and accepted into the “core” OpenStack release. Rapidly approaching is the new “Mitaka” release, the 13th release of OpenStack, filled with some great new features.

**Attempt to set up RDO Mitaka (RC1) at any given time (Delorean trunks)** by Boris Derzhavets

> "The RDO project has a continuous integration pipeline that consists of multiple jobs that deploy and test OpenStack as accomplished by different installers. This vast test coverage attempts to ensure that there are no known issues either in packaging, in code or in the installers themselves.Once a Delorean consistent repository has undergone these tests successfully, it will be promoted to current-passed-ci. Current-passed-ci represents the latest and greatest
version of RDO trunk packages that were tested together successfully"
