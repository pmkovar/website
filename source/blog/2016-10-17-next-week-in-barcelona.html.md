Join us next week in Barcelona for [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit). We'll be gathering from around the world to celebrate the Newton release, and plan for the Ocata cycle.

RDO will have a table in the Red Hat booth, where we'll be answering your questions about RDO. And we'll have ducks, as usual.

On Tuesday evening, join us for an [evening with RDO and Ceph](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/an-evening-of-ceph-and-rdo-tickets-28022550202), with technical presentations about both projects, as well as drinks and light snacks.

And, throughout the week, RDO enthusiasts are giving a [wide variety of talks](https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/) about all things OpenStack.

If you're using RDO, please stop by and tell us about it. We'd love to meet you, and find out what we, as a project, can do better for you and your organization.

See you in Barcelona!
