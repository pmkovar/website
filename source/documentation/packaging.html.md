# RDO packaging documentation

*RDO* is a community distribution of OpenStack which strives to provide the latest
upstream code packaged for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Fedora.


<div class="alert alert-info">
[Red Hat](http://redhat.com) also provides
[Red Hat OpenStack Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/openstack-platform)
which is based on *RDO*.

## Relation to upstream

*RDO* is a distribution of upstream code, not a fork. We strive to keep *RDO*
as close to upstream as possible with the minimum number of downstream patches.

## Open governance

When Red Hat launched the RDO community in April 2013, we chose to
focus our energies on making an OpenStack distribution available and
encouraging a self-supporting community of users around the
distribution, related tools, and supporting documentation. With this
community now established, it is clear we need to prioritize opening
up the RDO development process. Or, to put it another way, it is time
to begin opening up the technical governance of RDO.

This process will be discussed and fleshed out in more detail on
[rdo-list@redhat.com](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list).
