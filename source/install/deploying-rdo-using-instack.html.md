[‚Üê Installation and Configuration](/install/)

This tutorial covers how to deploy a [TripleO](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO) [Undercloud](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-incubator/devtest_undercloud.html) and [Overcloud](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-incubator/devtest_overcloud.html) using RDO and Instack on an all bare metal or an all virtual environment. TripleO is a program aimed at installing, upgrading and operating OpenStack clouds using OpenStack's own cloud facilities as the foundations - building on Nova, Neutron and Heat to automate fleet management at datacenter scale (and scaling down to as few as 2 machines).

## What is Instack?

[Instack](https://github.com/agroup/instack) is a scripted installer for an OpenStack TripleO Undercloud that uses [tripleo-image-elements](https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-image-elements). Using instack, you can quickly build an Undercloud to deploy your Overcloud.

## Preparing for Undercloud Deployment

The following sections describe the steps for preparing for an Undercloud deployment on all bare metal or all virtual machine environments using RDO packages and Instack.
