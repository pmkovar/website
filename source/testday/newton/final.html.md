title: RDO Newton GA Test Day

# Newton GA Test Day

We will be holding a RDO test day on October 13th and 14th, 2016

This will be coordinated through the **#rdo channel on Freenode**, and
through this website and the rdo-list mailing list.

We'll be testing the [Release Newton GA release packages](http://releases.openstack.org/newton/schedule.html). If you can do
any testing on your own ahead of time, that will help ensure that
everyone isn't encountering the same problems.

Update this page by submitting pull requests to [this 
repo](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website).

### Quick links:

* [Test scenarios](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-newton-ga-testday-testplan)
* [Known workarounds](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-newton-ga-testday-workarounds)

## Prerequisites

We plan to have packages for the following platforms:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

You'll want a fresh install with latest updates installed.
(Fresh so that there's no hard-to-reproduce interactions with other things.)

## How To Test

    yum -y install https://rdoproject.org/repos/openstack-newton/rdo-release-newton.rpm

* For Packstack make sure you set CONFIG_ENABLE_RDO_TESTING=y in your answer file, or that you use the â€“enable-rdo-testing=y command-line argument.
* Check for any [known workarounds](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-newton-ga-testday-workarounds) required for your platform before the main installation
* For Packstack based deployment start at step 2 of the [packstack Quickstart](/install/quickstart#Step_2:_Install_Packstack_Installer)
* For a TripleO-based installs, try the [TripleO quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/).
* See also the [baremetal deployment
  docs](http://images.rdoproject.org/docs/baremetal/) and [(minimal)
  virt deployment docs](http://images.rdoproject.org/docs/virt/) for the
  TripleO Quickstart. (Ping hrybacki on IRC for questions/comments.)

### Test cases and results

The scenarios we want to test are listed in the [test matrix
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-newton-ga-testday-testplan).
Please update that with scenarios that you think we should be testing.

* Pick an item from the list
* Go through the scenario as though you were a beginner, just following the instructions. (Check the [known workarounds](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-newton-ga-testday-workarounds) page for problems that others may have encountered and resolved.)
* KEEP GOOD NOTES. Update the [test matrix](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-newton-ga-testday-testplan) with your results, comments, and any tickets that you open.

If you have problems with any of the tests, report a bug to [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com) usually for one of the
